# Time_series_forecasting

The dataset used in this work is a public data set on transactions from 12/01/2010 and 12/09/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail company. 
The company is interested in maintaining the right inventory given its historical sales. The objective of this work is to build a model that predicts sales quantities for 
the 7 days from 11/27/2011 to 12/3/2011 Sun â€“ Sat for the top three selling items. Provide an estimated number of sales of these three items, broken by country.
